# Prove the kit's yamllint config does two things at once:
#
#   1. this repo's own YAML PASSES it. The `yaml` profile runs `yamllint --strict`, and on
#      yamllint's defaults that refused the kit's own files - 80-column lines, no `---`,
#      GitHub's `on:` read as a boolean, the aligned values of PROJECT.yml. A repo that
#      adopted the profile went red on files it got from this kit. Found by a session
#      assembling the kit into a new repo, 5 Oct 2026.
#   2. it still REFUSES broken YAML. A config that passes everything because it disables
#      everything would satisfy (1) and protect nothing, so every relaxation has a row
#      showing the rule around it still fires.

# Copied from the convention kit (repo-secret-scan tests/test-yamllint.sh at 6ba4337,
# 5 Oct 2026). Changed for this repo only where its layout differs: the config is the
# repo-root .yamllint.yaml, not the kit's templates/yamllint.yaml.
#
# Runs the version the profile pins (templates/profiles.yaml), through uv - never pip.
