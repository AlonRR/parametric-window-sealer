#   ./tests/test-hooks.sh
#
# Copied from the convention kit (repo-secret-scan tests/test-hooks.sh at 628aed2,
# 5 Oct 2026). Changed for this repo only where its layout differs: the hooks live in
# .githooks/ (the kit ships them in hooks/ and runs copies in .githooks/), so the
# paths point there, and the kit's block checking that those two copies match is
# dropped because this repo has only the one copy.
#
# A hook that accepts everything and a hook that is never invoked are
# indistinguishable from the outside: both look like a clean commit. And a hook that
# refuses too much is worse than one that refuses nothing, because the way people
# get past it is `--no-verify`, which switches off every other check in the same
# hook at the same time. So both columns below matter equally.
#
# The rows marked OLD-BUG are the cases the previous hand-written hooks got wrong.
# They are kept as regressions, not as documentation:
#
#   - `test:` was REFUSED by the old commit-msg hook, which required a scope, while
#     onedrive-sync/CLAUDE.md listed `test:` as a valid subject. The hook was relaxed to
#     match on 18 Sep 2026 - and on 5 Oct 2026 the owner REVERSED that for every repo:
#     "they must be type(scope): summary", "type: summary is forbidden". So a bare
#     `test:` is refused again, now deliberately, and the doc was corrected instead.
#   - `Merge ...` / `On main: ...` were refused, so any merge or stash needed
#     --no-verify - which also skipped the attribution check, the one thing in that
#     hook that cannot be fixed later.
#   - Gitea's lowercased address was refused by the old pre-commit hook even though
#     it is the same GitHub account. Measured 11 Sep 2026.
#
# Note what MUST PASS: "feat(bus): deliver to Claude Code sessions". Naming a product
# the code interoperates with is a technical fact a reader needs. The ban is on
# branding the AUTHORSHIP. A hook that matched the vocabulary instead of the trailer
# shape would refuse a correct commit, so that row is a real requirement.
