# Printer build volumes

The build volumes behind the default maximum piece size (Q5, Q38), and later the printer
list (`printer-presets`, #13). Every number was read from the maker's own website on
5 Oct 2026 and is quoted with its address; none is from memory, a retailer or a review.

**Group** is `mini` for the two small-bed printers and `full-size` for the rest. The
default of **200 × 200 mm** (Q38) fits every `full-size` printer here with at least 10 mm to
spare on each side of the bed's smallest dimension; the minis need "custom" or, later, their
entry in the printer list. `web/test/printer.test.ts` reads this table and checks that claim,
so a change to either one shows up in the tests.

## Notes on the sources

- **Bambu Lab**: bambulab.com refused automated reads (HTTP 403), so every Bambu Lab number is
  from Bambu Lab's own store. A new X1 Carbon is no longer listed there; the number is from its
  refurbished-unit page.
- **Bambu Lab P1S and X1C**: the maker notes that the popped-out filament-cutter stopper takes
  part of the print area, and that the slicer's default height is 250 mm. The 10 mm margin of
  the default is for cases like this.
- **Bambu Lab H2D**: 325 × 320 × 325 mm with a single nozzle; 300 × 320 × 325 mm printing with
  both nozzles.
- **Creality K1C**: read from the data embedded in the maker's store page, which shows no
  visible specification table. Creality's own KE FAQ gives the KE's volume under the SE's name;
  the comparison page above is unambiguous.
- **Sovol SV06**: its product page now redirects to the maker's home page, so the number is
  from the maker's own blog. The SV06 ACE is its current successor.
- **Renamed models**: Prusa's CORE One page now shows the CORE One+ (Gen 2), and its XL page
  the XL+; the numbers above are for the models those pages now show.
